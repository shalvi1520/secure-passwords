Password security is essential to keep your personal and sensitive information safe. It protects your online accounts, such as email, social media, and banking, from being accessed by unauthorized people.
Weak or reused passwords make it easy for hackers to steal data, causing problems like identity theft or financial loss. Secure passwords also help maintain privacy, prevent data breaches, and reduce the risk of cyberattacks. 
Hackers often exploit poor password practices to steal credentials, which can then be used for malicious purposes like phishing, fraud, or blackmail.
The Password Manager App is designed to securely store, retrieve, and manage passwords for various applications, such as Gmail, Instagram, and others. Each account requires strong, unique passwords to maintain security and protect personal data. However, remembering multiple complex passwords is a significant challenge for most users.
This project aims to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution to manage passwords for various accounts in one centralized platform. By simplifying password management and enhancing security, the app helps users save time, reduce stress, and protect their personal information from cyber threats.
